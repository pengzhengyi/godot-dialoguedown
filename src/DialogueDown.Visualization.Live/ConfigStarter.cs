        # Compilation mode for this project — how far a compile proceeds after an error. It applies
        # to the dialoguedown CLI and to embedded builds:
        #   stage-boundary  - stop at the first stage that reports an error (the default)
        #   best-effort     - recover through every stage and collect every problem
        # The visualization always renders stage-boundary, so every stage it shows is built from
        # reliable input; this setting does not change what the report displays. In Edit,
        # autocompletion suggests the key and its values.

        #   name     - how the speaker is shown (required)
        #   id       - an optional short id, referenced as @id in a script
        #   tags     - optional custom tags
        #   default  - set true to make this the document's default speaker (the ##default tag)
