 * Resolve one document before navigation continues (a tab change, node selection, or Edit→View).
 *
 * The current save (if any) is awaited first, so a decision is made on a settled state rather than
 * mid-write: Manual never prompts while a save is in flight, and its Discard is never a no-op.
 * A paused conflict/uncertain/waiting/error stays in place — navigation is never an implicit retry.
 * In Auto it flushes and awaits the latest generation, looping until the buffer is clean, so an
 * edit made during a flush is saved before navigation proceeds. It rechecks the mode and the
 * optional {@link isCancelled} signal before every follow-up flush, so switching to Manual (or a
 * newer navigation superseding this one) stops the follow-up saving and cancels this navigation
 * rather than driving stale Auto flushes. In Manual it runs the existing Save-or-Discard prompt for
 * whatever remains dirty.
