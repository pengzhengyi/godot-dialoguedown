## Unreleased

### Added

- Dialogue AST and the Markdown-to-Dialogue transpiler that turns the parsed
  Markdown into dialogue nodes — speaker/speech lines, flat scene-heading
  markers, choices, inline styling, game calls, tags, and jump indicators —
  behind the `IScriptTranspiler` seam.
- Initial OSS community files and CI configuration.
