# Live Visualization — File Launcher

> [!NOTE]
> Status: **implemented** (Component 3 of live visualization). Component 1 (Hot Reload)
> shipped a `visualize` command that serves one document from a loopback server and
> hot-reloads it. This component makes a **launcher** the uniform interactive entry
> point: `visualize` opens a browser modal — like VS Code's Open File — to browse the
> filesystem for a `.dialogue.md` **source**, choose the **root** it is served from, and
> pick a **mode**, then opens the report. CLI arguments pre-fill the modal; a fully
> specified command skips it. Browsing is unconfined and the serving **root** is shown and
> changeable in the modal (default: `--root` or the current directory). **Live editing**
> (Component 2) is deferred — its mode option shows disabled.
>
> Unlike the core library, this component is part of the "vibe-coded" visualization
> tooling (see the visualization note's maturity caveat); the core engine remains the
> carefully-reviewed surface.

## Goal and scope

Today you visualize one script per CLI invocation: `visualize scene.dialogue.md`. To
look at another script you stop the server and re-run the command, and there is no way
to discover scripts from the browser. The launcher makes visualization start from a
single, uniform place — a modal, like VS Code's Open File — that lets you choose a root
folder, browse the `.dialogue.md` scripts under it (however deeply nested), pick a mode,
and open the report. When you already know exactly what you want, the CLI arguments
pre-fill or bypass the modal entirely.

In scope:

- The launcher as the uniform **interactive** entry point for `visualize`.
- A modal to choose a **root folder** (default: the current directory), a **source**
  file that is a descendant of the root, and a **mode**.
- CLI arguments **pre-fill** the modal; a command that specifies the source, mode, and
  root **bypasses** it and opens the report directly. `--pick` always shows the modal.
- Static and hot-reload modes, reusing Component 1. The **Live Edit** mode is shown but
  disabled until Component 2.
- A way back to the launcher from a report.

Out of scope (deferred to later components):

- **Live editing** (in-browser editor, Save, dirty tracking) — Component 2. Its option
  appears disabled here.
- The non-interactive **`-o` export** (write a self-contained file, no browser) keeps
  its current direct behavior; the launcher is the interactive path only.
- Serving scripts from **multiple roots at once**, or a persistent recent-files history.
- A native OS file dialog (see [D2](#d2--a-server-side-browser-not-a-native-file-dialog)).

## Ubiquitous language

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Launcher** | The modal (and the server behind it) that is the uniform interactive entry point. |
| **Launch root** | The single directory subtree the launcher may browse and serve — the security boundary. Chosen in the modal (default: the current directory) or with `--root`. |
| **Source** | A `.dialogue.md` file, a descendant of the launch root, selected to open. |
| **Mode** | How the source is opened: **Static** (served once), **Watch** (hot-reload, Component 1), or **Live Edit** (Component 2, shown disabled). |
| **Open** | Confirming a root, source, and mode so the report is rendered and shown. |
| **Pick** | Forcing the modal to appear even when the command is fully specified (`--pick`). |
| **Session** | (Existing.) A rendered document the server serves; the launcher creates one per open. |

## Functionality checklist

- [ ] `visualize` (no arguments) opens the launcher modal rooted at the current
      directory, with `.dialogue.md` candidates highlighted.
- [ ] The modal chooses a **root folder**, a **source** under it (browsable to any
      depth, never above the root), and a **mode** (Static / Watch / Live Edit —
      the last disabled).
- [ ] CLI arguments **pre-fill** the modal: `visualize sub/scene.dialogue.md --watch`
      opens the modal with that source and Watch selected.
- [ ] A command that specifies **source, mode, and root** opens the report directly
      (no modal); `--pick` forces the modal even then.
- [ ] Opening renders the report and navigates the browser to it; the report behaves
      as today (tabs, mode badge, hot reload when watched).
- [ ] The report offers a **Back to launcher** affordance when opened via the launcher.
- [ ] Opening another source from the launcher replaces the active one.
- [ ] Requests for paths outside the launch root, or for non-`.dialogue.md` sources,
      are rejected.
- [ ] The non-interactive `-o` export path is unchanged.

## Architecture

`visualize` resolves its arguments into an initial selection (root, source, mode), then
either opens the report directly (fully specified, no `--pick`) or starts the launcher
server and opens the modal pre-filled with that selection. The launcher reuses
Component 1's server and session; it adds the modal page, two small APIs, and the
argument-to-selection mapping.

```text
visualize [args] ──► resolve selection (root, source?, mode)
        │
        ├── source + mode + root all set, no --pick ──► open report directly (Component 1)
        │
        └── otherwise ──► LauncherMode starts LiveVisualizationServer, opens the modal:
                              GET  /              → launcher modal (pre-filled selection)
                              GET  /api/browse    → folders + .dialogue.md entries (JSON)
                              POST /api/open      → set active session, 303 → report
                              GET  /<report>, /api/document, /api/events   (existing)
                              static files served under the launch root
```

- **The chosen root, mounted at `/r/`.** A `MutableFileRoot` serves static files under the
  root chosen for the active open, at the `/r/` mount, so a source's relative assets
  resolve in place and reports never collide with the launcher at `/`. Binding serving to
  the root removes Component 1's per-document serve-root negotiation: the root *is* the
  hosting consent for that subtree (see [Security](#security)).
- **One active session, swapped on open.** The server keeps at most one live session and
  swaps it when you open another source. This reuses the existing single-session server
  rather than generalizing it to many concurrent documents (a possible later extension).
- **Two-page bundles.** The report stays a self-contained single file
  (`dist/report.html`). The launcher is a **second** inlined bundle
  (`dist/launcher.html`), embedded in the assembly the same way, served at `/` with its
  initial selection injected like the report's data.

## CLI entry point

```text
visualize [<source>] [--root <dir>] [--mode static|watch|live] [--pick]
          [-o <file>] [--port <n>] [--no-open]
```

The command resolves an initial **selection** from its arguments, then decides how to
proceed:

| Argument | Effect on the selection |
| --- | --- |
| `<source>` (optional `.dialogue.md`) | Pre-selects the source. The root defaults to `--root` if given, else the current directory when the source is under it, else the source's own directory. |
| `--root <dir>` | Sets the launch root; the source must be a descendant. |
| `--mode static\|watch\|live` | Sets the mode. `--watch` and `--live` are shorthands for `--mode watch` / `--mode live`. `live` is accepted but not yet functional (Component 2). |
| `--pick` | Always show the modal, even when the selection is complete. |
| `-o <file>`, `--port`, `--no-open` | As today. `-o` is the non-interactive export and never opens the modal. |

**Bypass rule.** When `<source>`, `--mode`, and `--root` are all explicitly given and
`--pick` is absent, `visualize` opens the report directly (Component 1's static or watch
path). Otherwise, it starts the launcher and opens the modal pre-filled with whatever the
arguments did specify. So `visualize` alone opens an empty modal at the current
directory, `visualize scene.dialogue.md --watch` opens the modal pre-filled (root not
given), and `visualize scene.dialogue.md --mode watch --root .` opens the report
directly.

## Launch flow

1. `visualize [args]` resolves a selection. If it is complete and `--pick` is absent,
   the report opens directly (Component 1) and the steps below are skipped.
2. Otherwise, `LauncherMode` starts the server and opens `/`; the modal loads pre-filled
   with the resolved selection (root, source if any, mode).
3. The modal requests `GET /api/browse?path=` (absolute paths, unconfined) and renders a
   folder's sub-directories and `.dialogue.md` sources; navigating re-requests `browse`.
4. The user selects a source, adjusts the serving root, and picks a mode, then clicks
   Open → `POST /api/open { root, source, mode }`.
5. The server validates the source is under the root, sets the active root, (re)creates
   the active session for the source, starts the watcher when the mode is watch, and
   responds `303 See Other` with the report URL.
6. The browser follows the redirect to the report, which behaves as today. When watched,
   edits on disk hot-reload it (Component 1). **Back to launcher** navigates to `/`.

## Interfaces and abstractions

- **`ILauncherRunner` / `LauncherRunner`** (new, `DialogueDown.Visualization.Live`):
  `Task<int> RunAsync(string root, string? source, LaunchMode mode, int? port, bool noOpen, CancellationToken)`
  — resolves the launch root, serves the launcher page, and stays up until cancelled.
  Started by the CLI whenever the report is not opened directly. Parallels `WatchMode`.
- **`LaunchRoot`** (new) validates a root and confines a source to it (`ResolveSource` —
  normalizing `..`, rejecting absolute paths, following a terminal symlink), used to
  check an open. **`DirectoryBrowser`** lists any directory (unconfined) for `browse`;
  **`MutableFileRoot`** is the static-file provider that follows the chosen root.
  **`LauncherServer`** serves the page, `browse`, and `open`, swapping one active
  `LiveSession` per open and serving its report under `/r/`.
- The report/session path reuses `LiveSession`, `ServeRoot`, and `DocumentWatcher`; the
  CLI keeps using `IVisualizeRunner` for the direct (bypass) path and adds
  `ILauncherRunner` for the launcher path.
- **Frontend**: a `launcher.html` Vite entry with `launcher.ts` (the tested UI —
  browse tree, source/mode selection, open) and `launcher-main.ts` (browser wiring),
  built as a second self-contained bundle and styled with Pico to match the report.

## HTTP surface

| Method + path | Purpose | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /` | The launcher modal, with its initial selection injected (like the report's data) | `text/html` (embedded `launcher.html`) |
| `GET /api/browse?path=<dir>` | List a directory anywhere (absolute paths) | JSON `{ path, parent, directories[], sources[] }` |
| `POST /api/open` | Open a source under a root (`{ root, source, mode }`) | `303 See Other` → the report under `/r/` (or `400`/`404`) |
| `GET /r/<report path>` | The active session's report | `text/html` |
| `GET /api/document`, `GET /api/events` | The active session's data and SSE | Existing (Component 1) |

## Key design decisions

### D1 — The launcher is the uniform interactive entry point

`<source>` becomes optional on `visualize`, and the launcher — not a direct render — is
the default interactive entry. The command resolves a selection from its arguments and
opens the modal pre-filled with it. The one fast path is the **bypass rule**: when
`<source>`, `--mode`, and `--root` are all explicit and `--pick` is absent, the report
opens directly (Component 1). This keeps one obvious entry point (no sub-command) while
preserving a no-modal path for fully specified commands and `--pick` to force the modal.

### D2 — A server-side browser, not a native file dialog

A browser `<input type="file">` yields the file's *contents and name* but never its
absolute path. The tool needs the path to watch the file and resolve its relative
images, so a native dialog cannot drive it. The launcher instead browses the server's
filesystem through `GET /api/browse`, which also lets the server enforce the launch
root and the `.dialogue.md` filter.

### D3 — Multi-page navigation, not a client SPA

The report is a self-contained single file with embedded data; embedding a router in
it to host a launcher view would bloat it and entangle the two. The launcher is a
separate page and opening an entry is a full navigation (a `303` to the report). No
client-side router is introduced.

### D4 — The launcher is a second inlined bundle

`launcher.html` is a second Vite entry, inlined to a single file by the existing
single-file plugin and embedded as an assembly resource like `report.html`. This keeps
the TypeScript, styling, and Node-free .NET build consistent, at the cost of a second
build output and embedded resource.

### D5 — The chosen root is the hosting boundary

Browsing is unconfined — the picker lists any directory, like a native Open Folder — but
**serving** is confined to the root chosen for an open. The root defaults to `--root` or
the current directory, is shown in the modal, and is changeable (a "Use current folder"
control, or it re-roots to a source's folder when you pick one outside it). At open the
server validates the source is under the chosen root (`LaunchRoot`) and points a
`MutableFileRoot` at it, so `/r/` serves that subtree. This replaces Component 1's
per-document consent: the root *is* the hosting consent for its subtree, the server is
loopback-only, and only the chosen root's files are ever served (see
[Security](#security)).

### D6 — One active session, swapped on open

The server keeps at most one live session and swaps it when you open another source.
This reuses the existing single-session, single-serve-root server unchanged rather than
generalizing it to many concurrent documents (a possible later extension).

### D7 — A mode option group; live editing is deferred

The modal presents a **Static / Watch / Live Edit** option group (matching the CLI
`--mode`). Static serves once, Watch hot-reloads (Component 1). **Live Edit** is shown
but **disabled** ("coming soon") until Component 2 lands, so the launcher already
reflects the full mode set without offering a non-functional option.

### D8 — "Back to launcher" only when launched

The report shows a **Back to launcher** control only when it is served by a launcher
server (a flag in the injected report data), so a bypassed
`visualize scene.dialogue.md --mode watch --root .` report is unchanged.

### D9 — The `-o` export stays a non-interactive path

`-o <file>` writes a self-contained report to disk with no server and no browser, so it
cannot go through the modal. It keeps Component 1's behavior and is never affected by
the launcher; the launcher is the *interactive* entry point only.

## Error and boundary cases

- **Path escapes the root** (`..`, absolute, or a symlink pointing outside): `browse`
  and `open` reject it with `400`/`404`; nothing outside the root is listed or served.
- **Not a `.dialogue.md` file**, or the file was deleted between listing and open:
  `open` returns `404`; the page surfaces a message and refreshes the listing.
- **Empty directory / no entries**: the page shows an explicit empty state.
- **A watched, opened file is deleted**: handled by Component 1 (the report shows its
  deletion banner); **Back to launcher** still works.
- **Invalid `--root`** (missing, not a directory): the CLI fails fast with exit code
  `64` (usage), consistent with the existing argument validation.

## Security

The launcher exposes a filesystem-reading API on a loopback server, so path confinement
is the central concern.

- **Loopback only.** The server binds `127.0.0.1`, as Component 1 does.
- **Root confinement.** Every `browse`/`open` path *within a chosen root* is resolved
  against the active root and canonicalized (resolving `..` and symlinks); a result whose
  real path is not inside the active root is rejected. Absolute paths and traversal
  within a root are refused, and only the active root's files are ever served.
- **Extension filter.** Only directories and `.dialogue.md` files are listed or opened.
- **Unconfined browse, confined serving.** The picker lists any directory (a native
  folder chooser does too), but it only ever *lists* folder names and `.dialogue.md`
  files — never file contents — and serves nothing outside the chosen root. Choosing a
  root is a deliberate act; the server is loopback-only, and serving is always scoped to
  that root.

## Integration

- **CLI** (`DialogueDown.Cli`): `VisualizeSettings` makes `<source>` optional and adds
  `--root`, `--mode` (with `--watch`/`--live` shorthands), and `--pick`;
  `VisualizeCommand` applies the bypass rule — direct render when source, mode, and root
  are all set and `--pick` is absent, otherwise the launcher. `CliServices` registers the
  launcher runner.
- **Live** (`DialogueDown.Visualization.Live`): adds `LauncherMode`/`LauncherRunner`,
  `LaunchRoot`, and the `browse`/`open` endpoints on `LiveVisualizationServer`; reuses
  `LiveSession`, `ServeRoot`, `DocumentWatcher`, and the SSE broadcaster.
- **Frontend** (`web/`): adds the `launcher.html` entry and `launcher.ts`; the build
  emits a second inlined bundle; the report gains an optional **Back to launcher**
  control. Both bundles stay committed and CI-synced.

## Testability

- **Path confinement** (unit): `LaunchRoot` rejects `..`, absolute paths, and symlink
  escapes; accepts sources inside the root. Highest-value security tests.
- **Browse/open API** (integration): `LauncherServer` over a temp tree asserts `browse`
  lists only sub-directories and `.dialogue.md` sources, `open` returns `303` to the
  report under `/r/` and swaps the active session and serves its relative assets, and
  out-of-root or wrong-extension requests are refused.
- **Runner** (integration): `LauncherRunner` serves the launcher page and opens its URL.
- **CLI** (unit): the bypass rule — a complete `source + --mode + --root` (without
  `--pick`) invokes the direct runner, while any missing piece or `--pick` invokes the
  launcher runner (both substituted); the argument-to-selection mapping and validation.
- **Launcher client** (unit, vitest): `initLauncher` renders the tree, browses, selects a
  source, and drives Open through injected ports; `back-link` shows the control only
  under `/r/`.
- **Frontend e2e** (Playwright, live): a planned follow-up — launch over a temp tree,
  open a source with and without hot reload, and assert **Back to launcher** returns.
