## Goal and scope

The compiler should be able to tell an author **everything** wrong with a script in one pass,
not just the first fault, and show each problem in a clear, located, human-readable form. This
effort introduces, in components:

- a **diagnostic model** — a structured, located report of a problem found during compilation
  (a descriptor with a stable code, a source span, a severity, and message arguments);
- a **collection seam** — a per-compilation diagnostics context carrying a sink each stage reports into, so
  compilation **collects and continues** instead of throwing at the first fault, surfacing the
  collected diagnostics on `CompilationResult`;
- a **validator** — a pluggable set of **rules** that inspect a compiled artifact and report
  diagnostics (the linter-style pass);
- a **humanized renderer** — the CLI projects diagnostics into
  [Errata](https://github.com/spectreconsole/errata) so warnings and errors print with source
  snippets, carets, colors, and codes.

The core stays **dependency-free**; the only new runtime dependency is Errata, confined to the
CLI. An **LSP** projection and a **web-report** overlay are designed as planned seams, not built.

### Build versus buy, and observability

- **Diagnostic model — build (small, in core).** No third-party model fits a dependency-free
  core cleanly; the model is a handful of value types. It takes its *shape* from Roslyn and LSP
  (see [the comparison below](#the-diagnostic-model--options-compared)) but owns the code.
- **Terminal rendering — buy (Errata).** Rendering source snippets with carets is the expensive
  part to hand-roll. Errata does it, is Spectre-based (already a CLI dependency), and stays
  confined to the CLI (see [DD7](#dd7--errata-renders-on-the-cli-isolated-to-the-cli)).
- **LSP wire types — buy later, at the edge.** When the editor surface lands, its adapter uses
  an LSP types package; the core never takes that dependency (see
  [DD8](#dd8--lsp-and-web-rendering-are-planned-projection-seams)).

**Observability is a separate concern.** A stage-tracing signal ("now entering desugar") is
*operational logging*, not an *author-facing diagnostic*, so it does not belong in this model.
If stage tracing is wanted, add it separately behind `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`'s `ILogger`
abstraction, injected into the facade. That is out of scope here.

## Where it sits

Diagnostics are cross-cutting: every stage and the validator report into one sink, the facade
aggregates them onto the result, and each consumer projects the same structured diagnostics into
its own surface.

```mermaid

    subgraph compile["ScriptCompiler.Compile"]
        FE["Front-end"] --> TR["Transpiler"] --> DE["Desugar"] --> VAL["Structural validator<br/>(rules)"] --> SA["Semantic analyzer"]

    RES -.-> WEB["Report overlay<br/>(visualizer — planned)"]
    style compile fill:#2d6,stroke:#0a0,color:#000
```

The core owns the model, the sink, and (later) the offset↔line/column mapping. Renderers are
**projections** of the same diagnostics; the compiler never depends on a wire format.

## Ubiquitous language

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Diagnostic** | One structured, located report found during compilation: a `Descriptor` + a `SourceSpan` + a `Severity` + message **arguments**. The collect-and-continue counterpart to "throw at the first fault". |
| **Severity** | How serious a diagnostic is: `Error` (the script is invalid), `Warning` (it compiles but is suspect), or `Info` (a neutral note), ordered so `Error` is the worst. |
| **Descriptor** | The stable definition of one diagnostic *kind*: `Code`, `Title`, `MessageFormat`, `Category`, `DefaultSeverity`. Many diagnostics share one descriptor. |
| **Code** | The stable `DLG####` identifier on a descriptor — for docs, editor links, and (later) suppression. Its leading digit names its category. |
| **Category** | The kind of rule a descriptor belongs to: `Syntax` (`DLG1xxx`), `Semantic` (`DLG2xxx`), or `Style` (`DLG3xxx`). |
| **Message format** | A descriptor's template (e.g. `"Unknown speaker '{0}'."`); the renderer fills its placeholders with a diagnostic's arguments. |
| **Message arguments** | The per-diagnostic values that fill the format, kept structured (not pre-formatted) so composing the text belongs to the renderer. |
| **Diagnostic sink** | The seam (`IDiagnosticSink`) a producer reports a diagnostic into, so producers never know how diagnostics are stored. |
| **Diagnostic bag** | The concrete sink for one compilation: it collects diagnostics and hands back an immutable snapshot in report order. |
| **Diagnostics context** | The per-compilation bundle a stage receives: the original `Source` and the `Diagnostics` sink to report into. Replaces the bare `source` string threaded through the stages today. |
| **Collect and continue** | The stance the seam enables: a stage reports a recoverable problem and keeps going, so one run surfaces many problems. |
| **Validation rule** | One check (`IDiagnosticRule`) owning one descriptor: inspects an artifact and reports zero or more diagnostics. Pluggable and unit-testable in isolation. |
| **Line map** | A value that indexes the source's line starts once and converts a `SourceSpan` offset to a `LinePosition` (line, character), for the Errata/LSP projections. |
| **Unrecoverable fault** | A fault that leaves a stage unable to produce its artifact at all. It still **throws**; everything recoverable becomes a diagnostic. |

## Relationship to the error model

The [error model](./README.md#error-model) defines a throw-based exception hierarchy
(`DialogueDownException → ScriptCompilationException → SyntaxError / SemanticError`). This effort
**repartitions** faults along the recoverable axis rather than replacing that hierarchy:

- **Recoverable, author-facing problems** — a malformed jump, a tag without a speaker, a dangling
  `=>`, an unknown speaker — become **collected `Error` or `Warning` diagnostics**. Compilation
  continues, so the author sees them all.
- **Unrecoverable faults** — a stage genuinely cannot build its artifact — still **throw** a
  `ScriptCompilationException`. These are rare by design.
- **Usage errors** — a developer misusing the API (`null` argument, broken AST invariant) —
  remain standard `ArgumentException`/`ArgumentNullException`. Diagnostics are for scripts, not
  for calling code.

The two share one vocabulary: a diagnostic's **kind** (syntax vs semantic) and **location**
(`SourceSpan`) mean exactly what they mean in the error model, and the **code scheme** is the
same `DLG####` namespace. When error reporting and the renderer land, the error-model note
is updated so the README describes both channels (throw for unrecoverable, collect for the rest)
as one coherent story.

## The diagnostic model — options compared

The central choice is **how a diagnostic locates a problem**, because it must serve both the
near-term **linter** goal (collect and render during compilation) and a future **editor/LSP**
goal (a VS Code extension or the web editor consuming the same data).

| Option | Location representation | Linter fit | Editor/LSP fit | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A — offset-based** | a `SourceSpan` (start + length), like every AST node | Excellent | Needs an offset→`{line, character}` projection at the edge | Low; dependency-free |
| **B — line/column-based** | a `{line, character}` range, LSP-native | Awkward — forces a line index into every producer | Direct | Line/column mapping leaks into the core; tempts a wire-format dependency |
| **C — hybrid** | offset-based core **plus** a `LineMap` projection at each surface | Excellent | Excellent, via the projection | One extra `LineMap` seam — a *rendering* component |

**Decision: A now, growing into C.** The core model is **offset-based**: a `Diagnostic` carries a
`SourceSpan`, exactly like the AST it describes, so producers report with the spans they already
hold and nothing computes line/column on the hot path. Line/column is a rendering concern, so the
`LineMap` that option C adds lands with the **renderer**, not in the model. Choosing offsets keeps
the model tiny and free of any editor or wire-format concept.

## Component 1 — the diagnostic model (implemented)

The value types that describe a located problem and the bag that collects them, in a new
dependency-free `DialogueDown.Diagnostics` module. Every type is **`internal`** (the model embeds
the internal `SourceSpan`, and nothing public consumes a diagnostic yet), so tooling with friend
access (tests, the visualization project) uses it directly.

| Type | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `DiagnosticSeverity` | `Info < Warning < Error` (Error is the worst) |
| `DiagnosticCategory` | `Syntax` / `Semantic` / `Style`, naming the `DLG####` code ranges |
| `DiagnosticDescriptor` | the stable kind: `Code`, `Title`, `MessageFormat`, `Category`, `DefaultSeverity`; a guard rejects a malformed code (anchored `^DLG[0-9]{4}$`) or a code whose leading digit does not match its category |
| `Diagnostic` | one located report: `Descriptor` + `SourceSpan` + `MessageArguments` + a `Severity` that defaults from the descriptor; value equality compares the arguments element-wise |
| `IDiagnosticSink` | the report seam a producer writes to |
| `DiagnosticBag` | the per-compilation collector: an immutable snapshot in report order + a `HasErrors` convenience; a null report throws |

A **NetArchTest** rule guards the module as a foundation leaf — it may use `Common` (for
`SourceSpan`) but must not depend on any pipeline stage, so those stages can later depend on it
without a cycle. The types are unit-tested at 100% line and branch coverage.

## Component 2 — the collection seam (implemented)

The plumbing that lets the compiler collect and continue: a per-compilation diagnostics context carrying the
sink to each stage, and a result that surfaces what was collected. It adds **no producer** —
stages still throw for now; migrating them is a later component. The `DiagnosticsContext` lives in the
`DialogueDown.Diagnostics` module — the shared foundation both the stages and the facade can depend on,
since it carries the sink. See
[DD5](#dd5--the-sink-threads-through-the-facade-via-a-diagnostics-context) and
[DD6](#dd6--public-haserrors-internal-diagnostics-until-the-renderer).

| Type | Visibility | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DiagnosticsContext` | internal | per-compilation bundle: `Source` + `Diagnostics` (`IDiagnosticSink`) |
| `IScriptTranspiler` / `IScriptDesugarer` / `ISemanticAnalyzer` | internal | entry methods take a `DiagnosticsContext` in place of the bare `source` string |
| `ScriptCompiler` (facade) | internal | builds one `DiagnosticBag`, threads the context, aggregates the snapshot |
| `CompilationResult` | public (record) | gains `internal Diagnostics` (report-order snapshot) and a `public HasErrors` |

Because no stage reports yet, the seam is proved end to end with a **spy stage** that reports a
diagnostic when invoked; a facade test asserts it surfaces on `CompilationResult.Diagnostics` and
flips `HasErrors`.

## Component 3 — the structural validator (implemented)

The first **producer**: a pluggable structural lint pass that inspects the desugared tree and
reports diagnostics into the sink, turning the collection seam's spy into a real diagnostic end to
end. It ships the rule framework and the one rule the desugared tree can honestly support today —
**multiple jumps on a line** — plus the first catalog entry.

| Type | Visibility | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IDiagnosticRule` | internal | one check: inspect the indexed desugared tree and report zero or more diagnostics into an `IDiagnosticSink` |
| `DiagnosticRule` | internal (abstract) | base for a rule: guards its arguments, builds each diagnostic from the rule's descriptor, and hands the rule a `Reporter` closure, so a concrete rule only walks the nodes and reports a span with arguments |
| `MultipleJumpsOnLineRule` | internal | the first rule: a `Line` whose speech holds more than one `Jump` reports `DLG1003` (`Warning`), anchored on the line's span |
| `IStructuralValidator` / `StructuralValidator` | internal | the pass seam and its implementation: build the tree index once, run each composed rule over it, reporting into the sink |
| `ScriptCompiler` (facade) | internal | runs the validator over the desugared tree, between desugar and analyze, reporting into the context's sink |

Detection is purely structural: the validator builds a `DialogueTreeIndex` once and hands it to every
rule; `MultipleJumpsOnLineRule` takes each `Line` from the index and counts the `Jump` fragments
directly in its `Speech` — more than one is a `DLG1003`, and the message carries the count. Because
the validator emits a real diagnostic, the facade's collect-and-continue path is now exercised by a
genuine producer, not only a test spy. The rule reports the `DiagnosticDescriptor` it owns in the
central `DiagnosticCatalog` (per [DD3](#dd3--a-descriptor-catalog-with-dlg-codes)).

**Injection.** `StructuralValidator` sits behind an `IStructuralValidator` seam and is composed with
its rules, then injected into the facade like the other stages (wired by `ScriptCompilerFactory` and
`AddDialogueDown`), so validation is a real pipeline pass and the rule set can grow without touching
the facade.

**Shared traversal moves beneath the validator.** The rule must find every `Line`, including lines
nested in choices, without depending on the later analyzer. Two pieces that lived in
`Script.Semantics` relocated beneath the validator: the tree-walking helpers (`DescendantsAndSelf`,
`Children`) to `Script.Ast` — beside the nodes they walk — and the `DialogueTreeIndex` (which groups
a document's descendants by type) to `Script.Desugar`. Desugar, validation, and semantics now share
them without an upward dependency, and an architecture test guards that validation never reaches into
semantics. With two consumers now needing them, this is a fitting home rather than premature
generalization.

## Component 4 — error reporting and recovery (implemented)

Where the collect-and-continue model finally pays off: the compiler's recoverable **throw sites**
report a `Diagnostic` and **recover** — returning a sensible stand-in so the rest of the stage keeps
running — and a configurable **mode** decides how far a compile proceeds after an error. Together
they turn a dozen fatal exceptions into collected, located errors on the result.

Two stages own the throw sites this component migrates:

- the **transpiler** raises `DialogueSyntaxError` for a malformed line surface (syntax, `DLG1xxx`);
- the **semantic analyzer** raises `DialogueSemanticError` for meaning-level conflicts
  (semantic, `DLG2xxx`).

Every current site is **recoverable** — none is a genuine unrecoverable fault — so all twelve
migrate. Each keeps its existing message and span; only the *mechanism* changes from throw to
report-and-recover, and the two specific exception types give way to one mode-driven
`DiagnosticException` (below).

### Reporting and recovering

A reporting site needs two things the throwing code did not: a **sink** to report into, and a
**recovery value** to return.

- **Threading the sink.** The top-level stage methods already take a `DiagnosticsContext`
  ([DD5](#dd5--the-sink-threads-through-the-facade-via-a-diagnostics-context)). Each stage passes
  its `IDiagnosticSink` down to the inner builders that currently throw. A sub-pass takes an
  `IDiagnosticSink`, not the whole context — it only needs to *report*, so the narrower type keeps
  the dependency honest.
- **Recovering.** After reporting, the site returns a value that keeps the model coherent: a
  duplicate is dropped in favor of the first, a missing jump resolves to an `UnresolvedJump`, a
  speaker-less line falls back to the default speaker. The recovery is chosen so later passes see a
  *valid, if diminished*, artifact and keep collecting their own diagnostics.
- **Staying mode-agnostic.** A site always reports and then returns its recovery value; it never
  decides *whether* to stop. That decision belongs to the **mode**
  ([DD9](#dd9--compilation-modes-decide-how-far-a-compile-proceeds)), which lives in the sink and
  the facade — so the same site code serves every mode.

### The throw sites and their recovery

**Transpiler — syntax (`DLG1xxx`, `Error`):**

| Site              | Trigger                                                            | Code      | Recovery value                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| speaker builder   | a line has tags but names no speaker                               | `DLG1101` | drop the tags; recover the line to the default speaker                         |
| game-call builder | a code span is not a valid game call                               | `DLG1102` | keep the span's inner text as a literal text fragment                          |
| label/alt policy  | a link, image, code span, or break sits inside a label or alt text | `DLG1103` | drop the disallowed element; keep the surrounding text and styling             |

**Semantic analyzer — semantic (`DLG2xxx`, `Error`):**

| Site           | Trigger                                                                     | Code      | Recovery value                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| anchor table   | two headings slug to the same anchor — identical titles are the common case | `DLG2001` | keep the first scene for the anchor; the duplicate is not a jump target        |
| scene builder  | a heading has no sluggable text for an anchor                               | `DLG2002` | build the scene but register no anchor, so nothing can jump to it              |
| speaker binder | a name and an `@id` already name different speakers                         | `DLG2003` | keep the name's speaker; ignore the conflicting id link                        |
| speaker binder | an `@id` is already bound to another name                                   | `DLG2004` | keep the existing id binding; ignore the new name                              |
| speaker binder | a name is already bound to another `@id`                                    | `DLG2005` | keep the first id; ignore the later one                                        |
| speaker binder | two speakers both claim `##default`                                         | `DLG2006` | keep the first default; ignore later marks                                     |
| speaker binder | an `@id` is used but never given a name                                     | `DLG2007` | keep the id's speaker as an unnamed placeholder so id references still resolve |
| tag validator  | a `##tag` is not a known reserved tag                                       | `DLG2008` | leave the tag inert, treated like a custom tag                                 |
| jump resolver  | a jump targets an anchor no scene owns                                      | `DLG2009` | resolve it to an `UnresolvedJump`; keep resolving the rest                     |

Same-titled headings are the everyday form of `DLG2001`: a heading's anchor is its slug, and
DialogueDown deliberately **does not** auto-disambiguate duplicates the way GitHub appends `-1`, so
two headings with the same title (or any two titles that slug alike) claim one anchor and the
second is reported and dropped as a jump target.

The codes are added to the central `DiagnosticCatalog` (per
[DD3](#dd3--a-descriptor-catalog-with-dlg-codes)); each reporting site reports by referencing the
descriptor it owns there, and a test enforces that every code is unique.

### The unified exception

The two message-only exception types (`DialogueSyntaxError`, `DialogueSemanticError`) are
**retired**: a reporting site no longer throws, and *fail-fast* mode throws a single
**`DiagnosticException`** that carries the full `Diagnostic` (code, span, arguments) rather than a
bare message. One exception type serves every site because the diagnostic already names the problem.
Their now-childless abstract branches (`SyntaxError`, `SemanticError`) are removed with them; the
base `ScriptCompilationException` hierarchy stays for any genuinely unrecoverable fault a future
stage may hit.

### Pipeline integration

- **Transpiler / analyzer:** the inner builders and passes gain an `IDiagnosticSink` parameter and
  a recovery return where they used to throw. The transpiler entry and `SemanticAnalyzer.Analyze`
  already hold the context, so they pass `context.Diagnostics` down.
- **Facade:** the mode (from `CompilerOptions`) shapes the sink and the stage loop — a throwing sink
  for *fail-fast*; the collecting bag plus a **stage-boundary check** (halt when a stage reported an
  error) for the default; and run-every-stage for *best-effort* (see
  [DD9](#dd9--compilation-modes-decide-how-far-a-compile-proceeds)).
- **Result:** under the default mode a script with a bad jump or a duplicate anchor no longer throws
  out of `Compile`; it returns a `CompilationResult` whose `Diagnostics` carry the errors and whose
  `HasErrors` is true.
- **Visualizer:** a stage-boundary halt yields a partial result, and the visualizer projects it
  directly — the produced stages render as graphs while each unproduced stage becomes a disabled
  tab (see [Unavailable Stage Tabs](./Unavailable%20Stage%20Tabs.md), resolving
  [#111](https://github.com/pengzhengyi/godot-dialoguedown/issues/111)).
- **CLI (next component):** with the stages reporting, the CLI can render the collected diagnostics
  and set an exit code — the reason this component comes before CLI notification.

### Testing

- **Each reporting site** is unit-tested: feed the triggering input, assert the reported descriptor
  and span, and assert the recovery value lets the stage return a coherent artifact.
- **Each mode** is covered: *fail-fast* throws a `DiagnosticException` at the first error;
  *stage-boundary* (default) collects a stage's errors together and halts at the boundary;
  *best-effort* collects across stages. A script with *several* independent problems surfaces the
  right set for its mode through `ScriptCompilerFactory`.

### Deferred and out of scope

- **Warnings as errors.** Every mode keeps warnings as warnings today; promoting them, so an
  advisory like `DLG1003` can fail a build, is a planned per-run toggle — not built.
- **Dangling `=>` (`DLG1002`).** DD4 assigns the dangling jump arrow to a desugar producer, but it
  is a *new detection* (desugar degrades `=>` to text today), not a throw migration — kept out of
  this component's scope unless folded in.

## Later components (deferred)

- **Desugar producer for a dangling `=>`** — a linkless arrow is degraded to plain text today, so
  reporting it needs desugar to record that it dropped an arrow (see the corrected
  [DD4](#dd4--the-validator-is-a-set-of-pluggable-rules)). Deferred; not part of the producers
  component above.
- **Renderer** ([DD7](#dd7--errata-renders-on-the-cli-isolated-to-the-cli)) — a `LineMap`
  (offset→line/column), the CLI's Errata projection with exit codes and warnings switches, and the
  **public** diagnostic view built on the `LineMap`.
- **Editor seams** ([DD8](#dd8--lsp-and-web-rendering-are-planned-projection-seams)) — an LSP
  projection and a web-report diagnostics overlay, plus a front-end record of **dropped unmodeled
  Markdown** so it can be reported (today an `Ignore`d node leaves no trace).

## Key design decisions

### DD1 — One offset-based core model, internal for now

A `Diagnostic` locates a problem with a `SourceSpan` (offsets), the same value every AST node
carries ([option A](#the-diagnostic-model--options-compared)). Because `SourceSpan` is `internal`,
the model that embeds it is `internal` too — and that is the right default anyway: nothing public
consumes a diagnostic yet, so a public type would be speculative API. The test and visualization
projects have friend access, so they use the model directly. When the **renderer** surfaces a
public diagnostic view, it builds a line/column projection through a `LineMap`, so `SourceSpan`
can stay internal (see [DD6](#dd6--public-haserrors-internal-diagnostics-until-the-renderer)).

### DD2 — Three severities; report rather than throw

Severity is `Error`, `Warning`, or `Info`, ordered so `Error` is the worst — enough to answer
"did anything fail?" (`HasErrors`) and "what is the worst?". A stage or rule **reports** a
diagnostic rather than only throwing, so a run can surface many problems at once and
`CompilationResult` is returned with its diagnostics even when errors are present (**partial
compilation**). *How far* a compile proceeds after an error is a configurable **mode**
([DD9](#dd9--compilation-modes-decide-how-far-a-compile-proceeds)); only *fail-fast* still throws.
Each **diagnostic carries its own severity**, defaulting from its descriptor's `DefaultSeverity` —
a field now, so a future configuration pass can promote or demote one without reshaping the model.
The **diagnostic and descriptor are immutable value types** (records), safe to share and compare; a
diagnostic compares equal to another reporting the same problem, matching its **message arguments by
value** (element-wise). The **bag is the only mutable piece**, and only during one compilation.

### DD3 — A descriptor catalog with `DLG####` codes

Every diagnostic kind is a stable `DiagnosticDescriptor` carrying a `DLG####` code, assigned from
**category ranges**: `DLG1xxx` syntax, `DLG2xxx` semantic, `DLG3xxx` style — so a code's range
names its kind, and the descriptor validates that the two agree (an anchored `^DLG[0-9]{4}$` shape
plus a leading-digit check). Codes make a diagnostic greppable, documentable, linkable from an
editor, and (later) suppressible. The descriptor also owns a **message format** template; a
diagnostic carries the **arguments** that fill it, so composing the final text is a rendering
concern, never the model's — leaving room for localization later. The model defines the code
scheme and the descriptor type; the real descriptors live in one central `DiagnosticCatalog`, so
the codes stay greppable and documentable and a test can enforce that each is unique — each entry
arriving alongside the producer that reports it.

### DD4 — The validator is a set of pluggable rules

Validation is **rule-based**, like Roslyn analyzers or ESLint rules: each `IDiagnosticRule` owns
one descriptor, inspects an artifact, and reports into the sink. A registry composes the rules the
`StructuralValidator` runs, so each check is independently unit-testable and rules are added without touching
the pipeline. Rules split by what they need to see:

- **Structural rules** need only the **desugared AST** — no resolved model. They run in the
  `StructuralValidator` pass. The first rules are all structural.
- **Semantic rules** would need the **semantic model** and can only run after the analyzer. A
  **planned seam**, not built.

A **hard semantic error** — a jump whose target does not exist, a speaker that never resolves — is
**not** a rule: it is produced by the **semantic analyzer** inline as it resolves references,
because the analyzer already does that resolution. Validation you can do *before* a model exists is
structural; validation that *needs* the model is the analyzer's own output.

The first structural rule targets a problem the desugared tree can honestly reveal:

| Rule | Code | Severity | Trigger | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Multiple jumps on a line | `DLG1003` | `Warning` | more than one `Jump` fragment in a `Line`'s speech | **First rule** |

The other candidates once listed here are **not** desugared-tree structural rules, so they move
elsewhere — checking how the pipeline actually represents each condition reclassified them:

| Candidate | Why it is not a structural rule | Where it belongs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dangling jump arrow (`DLG1002`) | desugar rewrites a linkless `=>` into plain `Text("=>")` with no provenance, so the desugared tree cannot tell it from ordinary text | **Deferred** — a later desugar reporting site emits it where it degrades the arrow |
| Tag without a speaker (`DLG1101`) | the transpiler already **throws** `DialogueSyntaxError` for tags naming no speaker; the desugared tree never carries it | **Error reporting and recovery** — migrate that throw to a reported diagnostic |
| Dropped unmodeled Markdown (`DLG3001`) | an `Ignore`d node is dropped in the front-end and leaves no marker, count, or trace to detect | **Editor seams / future** — needs the front-end to record drops first |

### DD5 — The sink threads through the facade via a diagnostics context

The sink reaches the stages through a small **`DiagnosticsContext`**, not by adding a parameter to
every method. Each stage's entry method already takes the raw `source`
(`Transpile(markdown, source)`, `Desugar(script, source)`, `Analyze(desugared, source)`); this
replaces that bare `source` with a `DiagnosticsContext { Source, Diagnostics }` at the **stage
boundary only** — one signature change per stage, reusing the seam already there. Stages read
`context.Source` where they read `source` today; a producer later reports into
`context.Diagnostics`, typed as the write-only `IDiagnosticSink` so a stage can report but never
read the bag. The parser's `Parse(source)` is unchanged — its `source` is the input to parse, not a
threaded channel.

Three deliveries were weighed: a per-method sink parameter (too invasive), constructor injection
(stages are stateless singletons; a per-compilation bag would force a scoped lifetime), and a
**context at the stage boundary** (**chosen**). The facade creates **one `DiagnosticBag` per
compilation**, wraps it with the source into a context, passes that to each stage, and after the
stages run reads the bag's snapshot onto the result — the write/read split keeps stages as
producers only. Internal parsers and builders keep their `ParseResult` shape; only the stage
boundary learns about the context.

### DD6 — Public `HasErrors`, internal diagnostics until the renderer

`Diagnostic` is `internal` but `CompilationResult` is `public`, so the result exposes the collected
diagnostics as an **internal** member (friend assemblies and tests read them) plus a **public
`HasErrors`**. Three options were weighed: an internal snapshot + public `HasErrors` (**chosen**);
a public diagnostic DTO now (front-loads the public API and forces an offsets-vs-line/column choice
with no `LineMap` yet); and making the CLI a friend (leaks internal compiler types across a
boundary the architecture tests guard). The public *projection* of a diagnostic — most naturally a
line/column view built by the renderer's `LineMap` — lands with the **renderer**, so `SourceSpan`
stays internal and no speculative public contract is frozen now. `HasErrors` is enough for a
consumer to branch on failure (a CLI exit code) before the renderer lands.

### DD7 — Errata renders on the CLI, isolated to the CLI

The CLI already depends on Spectre.Console, so **Errata** (same author, Spectre-based) renders
diagnostics with source snippets and carets at near-zero extra footprint. The renderer maps each
`Diagnostic` to an Errata diagnostic with a label at its span (resolved through a `LineMap` over
the source) and colors it by severity. Errata is **pre-1.0**, so it is pinned and confined to the
CLI project; the core and its model never see it. If its preview status becomes a problem, the same
projection can target hand-rolled Spectre.Console panels without touching the core.

### DD8 — LSP and web rendering are planned projection seams

An editor/web surface consumes the **same** diagnostics through a projection that maps the core
model to LSP `Diagnostic`:

| Core | LSP `Diagnostic` |
| --- | --- |
| `Span` via `LineMap` | `range` (`start`/`end` as line/character) |
| `Severity` | `severity` (`Error`→1, `Warning`→2, `Info`→3, LSP `Hint`→4) |
| `Descriptor.Code` | `code` |
| — | `source` = `"dialoguedown"` |

The projection and any LSP package live in a **future adapter**, not the core. The model plus a
`LineMap` is enough to produce LSP ranges when the editor arrives. An LSP `Hint` is not a core
severity; it would appear only in this projection.

### DD9 — Compilation modes decide how far a compile proceeds

Reporting-and-recovering lets a stage continue past an error, but continuing blindly through every
stage piles cascading noise onto unreliable material. So *how far* a compile proceeds is a **mode**,
chosen through `CompilerOptions`:

| Mode | Behavior | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **fail-fast** | stop at the first error — the sink throws a `DiagnosticException` carrying the diagnostic | a quick "is it broken?" check |
| **stage-boundary** (default) | within a stage, recover and collect **every** error; at the stage boundary, halt if that stage reported any error, because its output no longer reliably feeds the next stage | everyday compiles — one stage's errors together, no downstream noise |
| **best-effort** | recover through **every** stage and collect everything | tools that want the fullest picture, such as an editor |

The mode lives in the **sink and the facade**, never in a reporting site: a site always reports and
returns its recovery value, so one throwing sink implements *fail-fast* while the collecting
`DiagnosticBag` plus a facade stage-boundary check implements the other two. Warnings never fail a
compile today; a **warnings-as-errors** promotion is a planned toggle, not built.

## Error and boundary cases

| Case | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Malformed code / range ≠ category | `DiagnosticDescriptor` throws `ArgumentException` — a usage error (a developer mis-defined a descriptor). |
| Empty bag | `Diagnostics` is empty; `HasErrors` is false. |
| Info/Warning only | `HasErrors` is false — only an `Error` flips it. |
| `null` diagnostic reported | `ArgumentNullException` — a usage error. |
| Snapshot immutability | the bag hands back a detached snapshot; a later report never changes a snapshot taken earlier. |
| Clean compile, no producer | `Diagnostics` is empty; `HasErrors` is false; a complete result. |
| Null source or sink into `DiagnosticsContext` | `ArgumentNullException`. |
| Errors present (later, once producers report) | a **partial** `CompilationResult` is still returned with all diagnostics; `HasErrors` is true. |
| Message argument/format mismatch | not checked in the model — composing the message is the renderer's job, so a mismatch surfaces at render time. |

## Integration

- **Core** (`DialogueDown`): the model module (done); then `DiagnosticsContext`, the stage
  signature change, the facade building and threading the bag, and `CompilationResult` gaining
  `Diagnostics` (internal) + `HasErrors` (public). No new runtime dependency.
- **Facade** (`ScriptCompiler`): creates the bag, threads it, runs the validator, and aggregates
  the diagnostics onto the result.
- **CLI** (`DialogueDown.Cli`): later adds Errata; `compile` renders `Diagnostics` and derives its
  exit code from the worst severity plus the warnings switches.
- **Error-model note** (`README.md`): later updated so the cross-cutting error section describes
  both channels — throw for unrecoverable, collect for the rest — as one model.
- **Visualization**: a diagnostics overlay on the report's Source tab, reusing the spans it renders.

## Testability

- **Model** — pure value types and an in-memory collector: descriptor code validation by category,
  severity order, the diagnostic's defaulting severity and element-wise argument equality, and the
  bag's ordered collection, detached snapshot, `HasErrors`, and null-report guard. A **NetArchTest**
  rule pins the foundation-leaf boundary. Built at 100% line and branch coverage.
- **Collection seam** — a **spy stage** reports a diagnostic when invoked; a facade test asserts it
  surfaces on `CompilationResult.Diagnostics` and flips `HasErrors`. A clean compile is empty and
  `HasErrors` is false. Existing stage/facade tests thread a `DiagnosticsContext` through a shared
  `DiagnosticsContextFactory` object mother, so the signature change touches one test helper.
- **Rules and the validator** — each rule is unit-tested in isolation: feed a small desugared
  artifact and assert the emitted descriptor, severity, and span. The `StructuralValidator` pass is
  tested separately — it builds one shared index and runs each composed rule over it — and an
  integration test through `ScriptCompilerFactory` confirms a two-jump line surfaces `DLG1003` end
  to end. A **NetArchTest** rule pins that validation never depends on the semantic layer. Built at
  100% line and branch coverage.
- **Renderer** (later) — assert the mapping (severity→kind, span→label via `LineMap`, code,
  message) against an injected `IAnsiConsole`, not rendered pixels.

Tests build dependencies through shared factories and use multi-line raw string literals for
script inputs so the parsed shape is visible.

## Resolved decisions

- **Severity set.** The core stays `Error`/`Warning`/`Info`. An LSP `Hint` is not a core severity;
  it appears only in the LSP projection.
- **Code numbering.** Category ranges from the start — `DLG1xxx` syntax, `DLG2xxx` semantic,
  `DLG3xxx` style.
- **Model visibility.** The model types are `internal` for now, not public; the public surface is a
  later `HasErrors` plus a renderer-built projection ([DD1](#dd1--one-offset-based-core-model-internal-for-now),
  [DD6](#dd6--public-haserrors-internal-diagnostics-until-the-renderer)).
- **Message shape.** A descriptor owns a message-format template; a diagnostic carries structured
  arguments — the final text is composed by the renderer, not stored in the model.
- **Exception conversion scope.** Land the model and the collection seam first, then migrate the
  recoverable throw sites to diagnostics in a clean follow-up, rather than converting them all at
  once.
- **Rule configuration.** Design the `dialogue.toml` rule-severity seam later, mirroring how the
  unmodeled-handling policy defers its configuration reader.
- **CLI switch names.** Keep `--max-warnings` and `-Werror`/`--warnings-as-errors`.
