# Third-party bundled libraries

The compilation report is built by the `web/` Vite project into a single,
self-contained HTML file (`web/dist/report.html`) with all JavaScript and CSS
inlined, so a generated report works fully offline with no CDN or network
access. The libraries below are bundled into that file. Exact versions are
pinned by `web/package-lock.json`; **none** of them is a NuGet or runtime
dependency of the DialogueDown packages — they ship only inside generated
report HTML.

`web/`, then rebuild (`npm run build`) and commit the refreshed
`web/dist/report.html` and `web/package-lock.json`.
