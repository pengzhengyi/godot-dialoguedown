# API reference

The generated reference for the **DialogueDown** core library — the
engine-agnostic C# library you integrate into a game. Browse the namespaces and
types in the sidebar.

Highlights:

- <xref:DialogueDown.Compilation.IScriptCompiler> — the single seam that compiles a
  script through the stages and returns a `CompilationResult`.
- <xref:DialogueDown.IGameSystem> — how the runtime reads game state and runs
  commands (`Query` and `Execute`).
- <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.DialogueDownServiceCollectionExtensions> —
  `AddDialogueDown()` container registration.

> [!NOTE]
> This reference currently covers the core `DialogueDown` library. The
> visualization and CLI projects are documented in the
> [design notes](../contributing/design-notes/README.md).
