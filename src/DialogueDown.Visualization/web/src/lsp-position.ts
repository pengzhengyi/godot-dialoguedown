 * the compiler's LSP geometry onto the editor the same way (mirroring the .NET `LspLineMap`).
 *
 * A line past the last one is a stale range (the buffer shrank since the compile); it clamps
 * to the very end so a marker still shows rather than jumping to the wrong line. The
 * character is clamped to the line's length for the same reason.
