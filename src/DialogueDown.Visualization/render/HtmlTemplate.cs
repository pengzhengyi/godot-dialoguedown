/// <summary>
/// Assembles a self-contained HTML report from one or more display graphs and,
/// optionally, the source they were compiled from. The page itself — D3, marked,
/// Pico.css, Tippy, the stylesheet, and the client script — is built ahead of
/// time by the <c>web/</c> Vite project into a single file
/// (<c>web/dist/report.html</c>) that is embedded in this assembly. All this step
/// does is inject the report data (the source and each stage) into that file's
/// data slot, so the report opens in any modern browser with no network and no
/// files on disk. The source becomes a "Source" tab and each graph becomes a
/// stage tab. Used for a single graph (<see cref="HtmlRenderer"/>) and for the
/// multi-stage report.
